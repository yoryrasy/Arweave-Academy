## Overview

The School of DumDum is a part of Arweave Academy developer education program. We offer developers free, high-quality courses and practical tasks to help them start building applications on Arweave and AO from scratch.  

Special thanks to [@K4y1s](https://x.com/K4y1s), [@sayestheorem](https://x.com/sayestheorem), [@rosmcmahon_real](https://x.com/rosmcmahon_real) and [@developer_dao](https://x.com/developer_dao) for support, and to [@OpenBuildxyz](https://x.com/OpenBuildxyz) for their guidance and assistance with the event process.

We divided this event into two parts: one for beginners and one for advanced developers.

- **Beginners** can enter the `Learning section`, where they will complete their learning by studying courses and submitting tasks.
- **Advanced Developers** can directly participate in the `Practice section` competition. You can choose a topic of your interest from the challange list and complete the practice by developing and writing tutorials. The best practices will be selected by judges and rewarded.

## Preparation

Before participating in the event, here‚Äôs what you need to prepare:

- An Arweave/AO wallet -- [Arconnect](https://www.arconnect.io/)
- An all-in-one Arweave AO relevant documentation list -- [awesome-ao](https://github.com/ArweaveOasis/awesome-ao)
- Arweave block explorer -- [viewblock](https://viewblock.io/arweave)
- AO explorer -- [aolink](https://www.ao.link/)

## Task Submission

> üì£üì£üì£ **Due to the recent influx of participants, the size of this repository has grown significantly. we've decided to archive the files in the Submissions folder that have already been merged. This step is being taken to reduce the repository size and ensure that the event can continue smoothly.**  [More Information](./submissions/Archive%20Announcement.md)


After each course there will be a series of tasks. These tasks will test whether you have mastered the course content. You will be redirected to the @OpenBuildxyz platform to complete the task and submit a screenshot of the result to your folder in the GitHub repository.

For example, to submit `task1`, follow these steps:

1. Create a `task1` folder under `submissions/YourName`.
2. Click [task1](https://openbuild.xyz/quiz/202501081) to open the `task1` page.
3. Please **log in** to the OpenBuild platform using your **GitHub account** to facilitate the subsequent statistical work.
4. Answer all the questions, take a screenshot of the result, and upload it to your `submissions/YourName/task1` folder.
5. Submit a Pull Request to this repository. Once your PR is merged, `task1` will be marked as complete.

Developers who complete all the courses and submit the tasks will receive a Level 1 Certification. If you earn all 4 Levels of Certifications in the future, you will be awarded a **Final Graduation Certificate** and become a priority candidate in our talent pool, gaining access to more job opportunities within the ecosystem.
